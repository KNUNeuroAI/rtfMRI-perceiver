# rtfMRI-perceiver
## Acknowledgements

This project builds upon the [Perceiver PyTorch implementation](https://github.com/lucidrains/perceiver-pytorch) by [lucidrains](https://github.com/lucidrains). We extend the model to address challenges in dynamic distribution change with small amount of data. We are grateful to the original authors for their foundational work which made this project possible.
